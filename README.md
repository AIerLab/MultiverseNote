# üåå MultiverseNote

## üìñ Introduction

MultiverseNote is an open-source project aimed at transforming AI chatbot interactions into structured project management workflows. This initiative enhances knowledge management and version control by converting traditional dialogue into a project-focused format. Through the introduction of a branch management system, users can discuss topics on the main branch and initiate new branches for in-depth exploration when problems arise. This allows for systematic and continuous knowledge development.

The project provides an intuitive interface for displaying all branches and managing them through drag-and-drop. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) includes identifying and merging branches through numbers, such as 123 or 145.

MultiverseNote addresses the need for an organized and persistent structure in AI chatbot environments, ensuring that discussions evolve into comprehensive project narratives.
