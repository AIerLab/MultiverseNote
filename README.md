# 🌌 MultiverseNote

## 📖 Introduction

MultiverseNote is an open-source project aimed at transforming AI chatbot interactions into structured project management workflows. This initiative is designed to enhance knowledge management and version control of historical records by converting traditional dialogue into a project-focused format. By introducing a branch management system, users can discuss topics on the main branch and initiate new branches for in-depth exploration when problems arise, allowing for more systematic and continuous knowledge development.

This tool supports an intuitive interface for displaying all branches and allows users to manage them through drag-and-drop. The most basic functionality (the minimum viable product, MVP) includes identifying and merging branches through numbers, such as 123 or 145.

MultiverseNote addresses the need for a more organized and persistent structure in AI chatbot environments, ensuring that every discussion can be developed into a comprehensive project narrative.
