# 🌌 MultiverseNote

## 📖 Introduction

MultiverseNote is an open-source project aimed at improving knowledge management and version control of historical records. By introducing a branch management system, users can discuss topics on the main branch and initiate new branches for in-depth exploration when problems arise. This management style allows new branches to refine discussions without affecting the main historical line and potentially merge the outcomes back into the main branch.

This tool supports an intuitive interface for displaying all branches and allows users to manage them through drag-and-drop. The most basic functionality (the minimum viable product, MVP) includes identifying and merging branches through numbers, such as 123 or 145.

MultiverseNote transforms the dialogue mode into a project mode, designed for long-term and in-depth discussions. When users encounter insufficient knowledge during conversations, they can proactively start new branches for more thorough exploration, ensuring that every detail is thoroughly discussed and addressed.

## 💻 Platform and Development Environment
