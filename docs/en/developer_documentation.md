# Developer Documentation for MultiverseNote

## Project Roadmap

Welcome to the MultiverseNote Developer Documentation. This document outlines the roadmap for the project, detailing stages and key milestones that will guide our development from inception to the full release.

### Overview

MultiverseNote aims to transform AI chatbot interactions into structured project management workflows. The development is structured into several key phases, each building upon the previous to gradually increase functionality and user engagement.

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Objective**: Establish basic functionality using React Native to handle simple project management tasks and branching dialogues.

- **Frontend**: Develop the initial user interface using React Native without a backend integration. Focus on basic app components such as project listing, branch creation, and basic navigation.
- **Core Features**: User authentication, project creation, and simple branching mechanics.
- **Timeline**: Q3 2024

### Phase 2: Utools Plugin

**Objective**: Extend functionality by integrating with Utools to provide enhanced utility through plugins.

- **Plugin Development**: Create a plugin for Utools that allows users to interact with MultiverseNote directly from other tools.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless functionality between the plugin and the main app.
- **Timeline**: Q4 2024

### Phase 3: Terminal Application

**Objective**: Develop a terminal-based application for advanced users who prefer command-line tools over graphical interfaces.

- **Backend Setup**: Establish a simple server using Node.js to handle API requests.
- **CLI Development**: Implement a command-line interface that mirrors the functionality of the GUI.
- **Timeline**: Q1 2025

### Phase 4: Full Frontend Development

**Objective**: Enhance the frontend with more advanced features and prepare for backend integration.

- **Advanced UI/UX**: Implement more sophisticated UI elements and user interaction capabilities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhance application responsiveness and data handling.
- **Timeline**: Q2 2025

### Phase 5: Full Backend Development

**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive backend system to support extensive project management features.

- **Database Integration**: Set up a robust database system to manage complex data and user interactions.
- **Backend Logic**: Develop complex backend logic to handle multiple users, extensive data processing, and security measures.
- **Timeline**: Q3-Q4 2025

## Future Milestones

- **Beta Testing**: Involve users in testing the integrated frontend and backend to refine features and UI.
- **Release Candidate**: Prepare and polish the final version for public release.
- **Official Launch**: Launch the fully integrated system with comprehensive support for multiple platforms.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing MultiverseNote, with clear objectives and timelines to guide our progress. By adhering to this plan, we aim to create a robust platform that fulfills the needs of managing AI-enhanced project conversations efficiently.
