# FAQ and Troubleshooting for MultiverseNote

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is the difference between our project and standard chatbot workflows?

**MultiverseNote** differentiates itself by transforming typical AI chatbot interactions into structured, project-management workflows. Unlike standard chatbots that process dialogues in a linear and temporary fashion, MultiverseNote introduces a branching system that mimics version control. This system allows for the preservation, revisiting, and branching of conversations, making it possible to evolve fleeting chats into structured and actionable projects.

### 2. Why is version control of AI chat histories important for project-wise development?

The ability to version control AI chat histories is pivotal for project management as it ensures that conversations can be archived, traced back, and built upon over time. Traditional chat patterns lack this capability, often resulting in the loss of valuable context and details necessary for understanding evolving project dynamics. Version controlling conversations allow for a detailed and historical perspective essential for long-term project success.

### 3. Why is our project focused on frontend development, and what backend services do we plan to use?

Initially, **MultiverseNote** emphasizes frontend development to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface. For backend functionalities, we intend to utilize powerful APIs, specifically the ChatGPT API for handling sophisticated data processing and AI interactions. This approach allows us to maintain a lightweight frontend while leveraging advanced backend capabilities provided by leading AI technologies.

### 4. Who are we, and why are we undertaking this project?

AIerLab consists of a dedicated team of researchers and developers with diverse backgrounds from prestigious global institutions. Our commitment is to advance AI applications in ways that are safe, user-friendly, and aligned with high standards of privacy and governance.
