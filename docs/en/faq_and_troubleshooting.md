# FAQ and Troubleshooting for MultiverseNote

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is the difference between our project and standard chatbot workflows?

**MultiverseNote** differentiates itself by transforming typical AI chatbot interactions into structured, project-management workflows. Unlike standard chatbots that process dialogues in a linear and temporary fashion, MultiverseNote introduces a branching system that mimics version control. This system allows for the preservation, revisiting, and branching of conversations, making it possible to evolve fleeting chats into structured and actionable projects.

### 2. Why is version control of AI chat histories important for project-wise development?

The ability to version control AI chat histories is pivotal for project management as it ensures that conversations can be archived, traced back, and built upon over time. Traditional chat patterns lack this capability, often resulting in the loss of valuable context and details necessary for understanding evolving project dynamics. Version controlling conversations allows for a detailed and historical perspective essential for long-term project success.

### 3. Why is our project focused on system integration with Taipy, and what backend services do we plan to use?

Initially, **MultiverseNote** emphasizes integrating the entire system using **Taipy**. Taipy serves as both the frontend and UI framework, allowing for a cohesive experience with the backend. Our backend development includes robust database systems and API servers to support extensive project management. The backend logic is developed to manage multiple users, data processing, and ensure security.

### 4. Who are we, and why are we undertaking this project?

**AierLab** consists of a dedicated team of researchers and developers with diverse backgrounds from prestigious global institutions. Our commitment is to advance AI applications in ways that are safe, user-friendly, and aligned with high standards of privacy and governance. MultiverseNote is a direct reflection of our goal to make AI more accessible and practical for everyday project management tasks, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

### 5. What are the future plans for the frontend of MultiverseNote?

As part of future development, we plan to enhance the frontend using the latest web frameworks. This will be part of a continued effort to provide a responsive and visually appealing user experience. The integration with Utools will also be an important aspect of future updates, making MultiverseNote more accessible from different environments.
