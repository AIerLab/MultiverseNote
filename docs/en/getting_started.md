# Getting Started with MultiverseNote

Welcome to MultiverseNote! This document will guide you through setting up your development environment for the frontend, which is built with React Native. Follow these steps to get started with development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

## Installing React Native

We use React Native to develop our mobile application. To get started, you need to install the React Native CLI. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the MultiverseNote repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiverseNote.git
cd MultiverseNote
```

## Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Before starting development, you need to configure the local environment settings. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary configurations as follows:

```plaintext
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Adjust the `API_URL` as necessary based on your local or development environment.

## Starting Development Server

To start the development server and run the app in the development mode, execute:

```bash
react-native start
```

To run the app on a specific simulator or device, you can use:

```bash
react-native run-ios     # For iOS
react-native run-android # For Android
```

Make sure you have an iOS simulator or Android emulator set up correctly. For iOS, you need Xcode installed on your Mac. For Android, you need Android Studio and the Android SDK set up.

## Entry Point

The entry point for the MultiverseNote app is the `App.js` file located in the root of the project directory. This file sets up the app navigation and global styles.

## Next Steps

Now that you have the app running, you can start developing new features. Here are some suggestions for next steps:
- Familiarize yourself with the project structure and coding guidelines.
- Look through open issues in the project repository to find something you can start working on.
- Join our developer chats to stay updated and collaborate with other developers.

## Conclusion

Thank you for contributing to MultiverseNote! We appreciate your effort to help improve this project. If you encounter any problems, please raise an issue on the GitHub repository or contact the project maintainers.
