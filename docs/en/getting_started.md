Here's the updated **Getting Started with MultiverseNote** guide, including examples with comments for configuration files, tools, and agents:

# Getting Started with MultiverseNote

Welcome to MultiverseNote! This guide will walk you through the updated steps for setting up and running the project, along with configuration details for customization. The setup process has been streamlined to use `uv` for management, simplifying the workflow.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the backend and management scripts.

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install `uv`

The project is managed with `uv`, which handles all configurations and dependencies. To install `uv`, run:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Step 2: Synchronize Project Files

After installing `uv`, use it to set up the project. Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command will download and configure all necessary dependencies and files.

### Step 3: Start the Project

Once synchronization is complete, start the project by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the backend and initialize the application.

---

## Configuration

MultiverseNote allows customization through configuration files and modular components. Follow these steps to update configurations and extend functionality:

---

### 1. Update Configuration Files

Configurations are stored in the `storage/config` directory. To update or customize settings:

1. Navigate to `storage/config`.
2. Open the desired configuration file (e.g., `main_config.yaml` by default) for editing.
3. Modify the configuration as needed.

#### Example Configuration File with Comments

```yaml
control:  
  bot:  
    api_key:  # Enter the API key for your bot service.
    name: OpenAI  # Name of the bot (e.g., OpenAI).
  tools:  
    - searchOnlineTool  # List of tool names available for the bot to use.

dao:  
  db:  
    activate: false  # Set to true if using a database; false otherwise.
    db_name: storage/db/db.sqlite  # Path to the database file.
    db_type: sqlite  # Type of database (e.g., sqlite, postgres, etc.).
    db_url: null  # Database URL (if applicable).
    password: null  # Database password (if applicable).
    user: null  # Database username (if applicable).
  file:  
    activate: false  # Set to true if using file-based storage.
    file_path: storage/file  # Path to the file storage location.

runtime:  
  agent_path: storage/agent  # Directory where agent configurations are stored.
  current_session_id:  # Leave empty for runtime-generated session IDs.
  history_path: storage/history  # Path to store conversation history.

view:  
  flask:  
    activate: true  # Enable Flask server.
    debug: true  # Enable debugging mode for development.
    host: localhost  # Host address for the Flask server.
    port: 5000  # Port for the Flask server.
  taipy:  
    activate: false  # Enable Taipy-based frontend (set to true if using).
```

---

### 2. Add Your Agent

To add a custom agent:

1. Place your agent's file in the `storage/agent` directory.
2. Follow the same structure and naming conventions as the existing agent files.
3. Restart the application to load the new agent.

#### Example Agent File with Comments

```yaml
name: base  # The name of the agent.
args:  
  - query  # Arguments required by the agent (e.g., query for conversation input).
prompt: >  
  ## Participant Profile  
  **Name:** KK  
  **Role:** A helpful assistant.  

  ## Dialogue with USER  
  While the people asking question is busy with work, should keep the reply concise, KK engages USER in conversation. USER begins by saying: "{query}"  
```

---

### 3. Add Your Own Tools

To integrate new tools into the application:

1. Navigate to the `app/tools` directory.
2. Add your tool file to the directory.
3. Follow the existing patterns in other files within the directory to ensure compatibility.

#### Example Tool Definition with Comments

```python
import requests

def fetch_web_page(url):
    """Fetches and returns the content of a web page."""
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for non-200 responses.
        return response.text
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return "Failed to access: " + str(e)

def search_duckduckgo(query):
    """Use the DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API to search for a query and return a structured JSON response."""
    url = "https://api.duckduckgo.com/"
    params = {
        'q': query,      # The search query text.
        'format': 'json', # Response format in JSON.
        'no_html': 1,     # Remove HTML from responses.
        'skip_disambig': 1  # Skip disambiguation pages.
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        return data  # Return raw JSON data from DuckDuckGo API.
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}

FUNCTION_MAPPING = {
    "fetch_web_page": fetch_web_page,  # Map function name to its implementation.
    "search_duckduckgo": search_duckduckgo,  # Another mapped function.
}

TOOLS_DEFINE = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "fetch_web_page",
            "description": "Fetches and returns the content of a web page.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "url": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The URL of the web page to fetch."
                    }
                },
                "required": ["url"]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "search_duckduckgo",
            "description": "Simulates a simple DuckDuck Go search and returns the first result URL.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The search query to look up on DuckDuckGo."
                    }
                },
                "required": ["query"]
            }
        }
    }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Verify Python 3.8+ is installed and working correctly.
2. Ensure `uv sync` was run successfully without errors.
3. Double-check the file structure and naming conventions in the configuration, agent, and tools directories.
4. Consult terminal logs for detailed error messages.
5. Raise an issue on the GitHub repository or contact project maintainers for support.
